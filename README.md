# Zerodha Clone

A responsive frontend clone of the popular Indian stockbroking platform **Zerodha**, built using modern web technologies to replicate its sleek UI and seamless user experience.

---

##  Project Overview

Zerodha-Clone is structured into two primary sections:

### Frontend (UI/UX)

- Developed using **React**, **JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **HTML**.
- Fully **responsive design**, mirroring Zerodha’s intuitive interface.
- Includes pages such as:
  - **Home** — Hero banner, awards, stats, pricing, education, and open account sections.
  - **About** — Company overview and team highlights.
  - **Pricing** — Transparent brokerage and account-opening info.
  - **Product** — Highlights offerings like Kite, Console, Coin, Kite Connect, etc.
  - **Signup Redirect** — Simulates account creation flow via Signup component.

### Dashboard (Optional/MERN Stack)

If integrated, the dashboard would include:
- **Stock Data** — Real-time or mock quotes
- **Portfolio Management** — Holdings, funds, positions
- **Order Management** — Place, view, update orders
- **Charts & Visualizations** — Doughnut charts, vertical bar graphs, summary stats
- **Watchlist** — Track favorite stocks  
*(This richer dashboard structure mirrors a MERN-based repository with React frontend and real-time data handling)* :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
